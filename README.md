# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The goal of this project is to use the dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company to create models that will predict whether a loan is high-risk or low-risk. As the majority of loans are low risk or good loans the dataset will be unbalanced with high risk loans being in the minority. 

We will use several machine learning models to balance the data and then evaluate the performance of the models based on a the accuracy score and classification report. 

* Random Oversampling
* SMOTE
* Cluster Centroid Undersampling
* SMOTTEEN
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier
* Easy Ensemble Classifier
